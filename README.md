# Philosopher

Philosopher is a simulation of the dining philosophers problem, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It aims to demonstrate concurrent programming concepts and synchronization techniques. The program simulates a scenario where multiple philosophers sit at a table and compete for limited resources (forks) to eat their meals.

The main objective of the Philosopher project is to explore concurrent programming challenges and solutions. It provides a practical demonstration of the dining philosophers problem, which involves managing shared resources and avoiding deadlocks and starvation.

## Key Features:

- Multiple philosopher simulation: The program simulates multiple philosophers sitting at a table and competing for forks to eat.
- Resource management: Philosopher implements mechanisms to handle resource allocation and deallocation, ensuring fair access to forks.
- Synchronization techniques: The program incorporates synchronization techniques, such as mutexes or semaphores, to prevent conflicts and ensure proper resource sharing.
- Deadlock avoidance: Philosopher employs strategies to prevent deadlocks, such as implementing a resource hierarchy or limiting the number of philosophers allowed to pick up forks simultaneously.
- Starvation prevention: The program includes measures to prevent philosopher starvation, ensuring that each philosopher has a fair chance to eat.

*By working on Philosopher, you will gain practical experience in concurrent programming, synchronization mechanisms, and dealing with shared resources. It challenges your ability to design efficient and robust solutions for managing multiple threads and coordinating their activities.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a full-fledged solution for concurrent programming problems in production environments.
